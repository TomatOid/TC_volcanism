## Tropical Cyclone Code

### Setting up

This code requires data to run.

- To generate the 1d-figures with `run_analysis_1d.m` it requires:
    1. `volcano_data.mat` generated by `process.m`, which depends on `eVolv2k_v3_EVA_AOD_-500_1900_1.nc` and `eVolv2k_v3_ds_1.nc` (the raw evolv2k dataset)
    2. `LMR21_renamed_ens_[x].mat` which has been standardized by `rename_lmr_fields.m` and depends on `LMR21_Atl_storms_[x].mat`
    3. `cera20_standardized.mat` which has been standardized by `standardize_vars.m` and depends on `Atlantic_AL_cera20c_reanal.mat`
    4. To run cluster analysis for LMR, you will need to run `cluster_storms.m` to generate `clusters.mat`. 
- This file contains two sections, the first one runs the analysis for LMR, the next section runs it for CERA.
- The important variables to consider when running the analysis for both datasets are `before` and `after`. This sets the size of 
the analysis window around each event. 
- When running analysis for LMR, the analysis can be run over multiple AOD thresholds. For this, use the `thresholds` variable.
- The `reigions` variable controls which hemispheres are used. `reigions = 'nts'` means eruptions attributed to the northern hemisphere
(latitude > 10), tropics (latitude between 10 and -10), and southern hemisphere (latitude < -10) will be included.
