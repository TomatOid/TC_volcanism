## Tropical Cyclone Code

### Setting up

This code requires data to run.

- To generate the 1d-figures with `run_analysis_1d.m` it requires:
    1. `volcano_data.mat` generated by `process.m`, which depends on `eVolv2k_v3_EVA_AOD_-500_1900_1.nc` and `eVolv2k_v3_ds_1.nc` (the raw evolv2k dataset)
    2. `LMR21_renamed.mat` which has been standardized by `rename_lmr_fields.m` and depends on `LMR21_Atl_storms.mat`
    3. `cera20_standardized.mat` which has been standardized by `standardize_vars.m` and depends on `Atlantic_AL_cera20c_reanal.mat`
